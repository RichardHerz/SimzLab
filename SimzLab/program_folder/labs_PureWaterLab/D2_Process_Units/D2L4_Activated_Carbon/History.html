Lowitzusingestablished knowledge of the adsorption power of porous carbon on odorvaporsapplied this to aqueous solutions (Hassler, 1974).&nbsp; Charcoal wasused todecolorize these aqueous solutions.&nbsp; This was the first knownaccount ofusing charcoal to adsorb compounds in the liquid phase.&nbsp; Buildingfrom theworks of its precursors, an English sugar refinery in 1794 wassuccessfullyable to use wood char to decolorize the sugar syrups that were beingproduced.&nbsp; By 1808, all the sugar refineries located in Europewere now using charcoal as a decolorizing agent and by 1815, most oftherefineries switched over to the newly developed bone char as thedecolorizingagent (<i>History of Carbon and Carbon Materials, </i>1995-2006).&nbsp;Thebone char enhanced the capacity of the decolorizing agent.&nbsp;			</td>		</tr>	</table><table style="width: 90%" align="center">	<tr>		<td>At the turn of the century, a major advancement intheprogression of modern commercial activated carbon occurred.&nbsp; Von Ostrejko patented, in 1900 and 1901,twoseparate processes in which porous carbon was given greater adsorbingpower.&nbsp; The first of the two processes incorporated addingmetallicchlorides with the carbonaceous materials before the carbonizationstage.&nbsp;The other patent involved gentle selective oxidationof the charred carbonaceous material with carbon dioxide or steam atelevatedtemperatures.&nbsp; These processes had the interest of the peoplebecause ofthe great potential activated carbon meant to the sugar cane industry(Hassler,1974).		</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td><br>It was not until the introduction of chemical warfare in World 		War I that the world saw the need for large-scale production of 		activated carbon.&nbsp; It was known from previous experiments that 		certain materials could be used to adsorb the toxic vapors created from 		the chemical weapons used.&nbsp; Activated carbon was used in its 		granulated form, because of the adequate adsorption power and the 		relatively low resistance to air flow through the canister of the gas 		masks that were developed.&nbsp; The first set of gas masks used 		activated wood chips through activation with zinc chloride (<i>Historyof Carbon and Carbon Materials, </i>1995-2006).&nbsp; Later researchduring thewar concluded that coconut shells, as the activated carbon source, gavethebest results in the gas mask canisters.&nbsp; The developments thatoccurredduring wartime resulted in a post war expansion in the commercialproduction ofactivated carbon, with emphasis on the production of activated carbonfromcoconut and almond shells.&nbsp; This post war expansion has lead tothewidespread use of activated carbon as a filter media in many dailyprocesses.</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>&nbsp;</td>	</tr></table></div></body></html>
