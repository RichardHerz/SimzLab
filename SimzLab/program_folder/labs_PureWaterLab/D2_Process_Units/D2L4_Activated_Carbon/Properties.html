Iodine is the most fundamentalparameter used to characterize performance and is widely used as anadsorbatestandard to the adsorption capacity.&nbsp; It reveals the ability toadsorbsmall molecules; a higher number indicates a higher degree ofactivation.&nbsp;Because Iodine has a relatively low molecular weight, the Iodine numberappropriately measures the adsorption capacity of the micropore (0-20&Aring;)structure of the activated carbon.&nbsp; The specific definition ofIodinenumber is the milligrams of Iodine adsorbed by one gram ofcarbon.&nbsp; Thisvalue can also approximate the inner surface area of the carbonparticle in m<sup>2</sup>/g.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Molasses Number / Decolorizing Index:</u>&nbsp;The valueof the molasses number is used for measuring the decolorizingperformance ofthe carbon sample.&nbsp; The color pigments that are within molassesare ratherlarge molecules and cannot penetrate into the micropore structure ofthe carbonsample.&nbsp; Therefore, the molasses number is also an approximationof theadsorption capacity of the carbon sample in the macropore (&gt;500&Aring;).</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Methylene Blue</u>:&nbsp; The value of theMethylene blueparameter is very similar to that of the Iodine number.&nbsp; TheMethyleneblue parameter measures the adsorption capacity of medium sizedparticles.&nbsp; It differs from Iodine Number in that the MethyleneBlueparameter measures the adsorption capacity of the mesopore structure(20-500&Aring;).&nbsp; The greater the value the Methylene blue parameter, thebetter thecarbon sample will adsorb particles in the mesopore region of itsintricatepore structure.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Surface Area</u>:&nbsp; The total surface areaof thecarbon sample is a very important parameter that classifies the carbonsampleoverall activity level or adsorption capacity.&nbsp; The total surface area of 		the carbon sample varies with the type of carbonaceous material used and 		the degree of activation that the carbonaceous undergoes.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Apparent Density</u>: When talking aboutactivatedcarbon, especially granular activated carbon, a regular density wouldnotdescribe anything useful.&nbsp; It would basically describe a solidwithout ahigh degree of surface area and, in turn, would describe a solid withessentially no apparent adsorptive capacity.&nbsp; A much more sensiblemethodfor describing the density of a carbon sample is the apparentdensity.&nbsp;The apparent density is the mass of the nonstratified dry activatedcarbon perunit volume of activated carbon.&nbsp; A higher apparent density meansgreatvolume activity.&nbsp; Therefore, the apparent density will be aconsiderablyreduced value from the standard density, because of the intricatenetwork ofpores a sample of activated carbon possess.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Particle Size/Mesh Size</u>:&nbsp; The particlesize of asample of activated carbon is very useful in determining designparameters fora given activated carbon filtration system.&nbsp; Some of the designconsiderations that need to be taken into account when deciding on themeshsize of the carbon used is: pressure drop in bed, adsorption capacity,rate ofbackwash stream, concentration of contaminants in the influentstream.&nbsp; Asmaller mesh size of carbon will increase the rate of adsorption andalsoincrease the pressure drop across the fluidized bed.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Hardness/Abrasion Number:</u> The abrasionnumber isusually applicable in systems where there is a frequent, continuous useofgranular carbon.&nbsp; The Hardness/Abrasion Number indicates theresistance toattrition and its physical integrity.&nbsp; It is an importantindicator ofactivated carbon to maintain its physical integrity and withstandfrictionalforces; a high relative value of hardness correlates with a reducedamount ofcarbon loss.&nbsp; Hardness becomes very important in the flow influidizedbeds.&nbsp; Carbon with a low abrasion number may become brittle andfall apartunder the pressure of the influent stream.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Ash Content:</u> Ash is the mineral residue that is left on the 		surface of a carbon sample after activation or regeneration.&nbsp;

Depending on 		the mineral residues present on the carbon, pretreatment of the carbon 		may reduce the ash content.&nbsp; In some cases, the natural ash found 		on the carbon sample will not affect the nature of the adsorption 		process.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td><u>Tannin</u>: The tannin describes the ability of the activated 		carbon with macropores and measpores to adsorb a mixture of large and 		medium size molecules.&nbsp;
