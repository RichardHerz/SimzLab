When exhaustion of the activated carbonoccurs, nomore adsorbates can be adsorbed onto the surface of the carbon.&nbsp;At thispoint, there are two options.&nbsp; The first option is to dispose ofthecarbon and replace it with new virgin granular activated carbon.&nbsp;Theother option is to have the exhausted activated carbonreactivated.&nbsp;Reactivation is the process of ridding the activated carbon of theadsorbedadsorbates.&nbsp; Reactivation can be done onsite, or one could sendthe spentcarbon to a company offsite to have it reactivated.&nbsp; There aresomeeconomic issues that surround the question on &ldquo;should I send mycarbon offsiteor invest in onsite equipment.&rdquo;&nbsp; To answer the question, thefrequency ofvirgin or reactivated carbon becoming exhausted would need to beaddressed.&nbsp;If the design parameters dictate an exhaustion rate in the magnitude ofyearsthen it would not be economically sounds to invest in onsite equipmenttoreactivate the spent carbon.&nbsp; However, if the exhaustion rate iscloser toonly a few months and the activated carbon system is a large scale theninvesting in onsite reactivation equipment may be a wisedecision.&nbsp; Inwater treatment plants, the general practice is to replace spent carbonwithvirgin carbon.&nbsp; The basis of this practice is because activatedcarbonused on the treatment of water has a relatively long shelf life due tothe lowcontaminant concentration of the water.		&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Thermal regeneration furnaces are used to create the elevated 		temperature environment for the spent carbon.&nbsp; There are different 		kinds of furnaces that are in use today.&nbsp; Customary used furnaces 		are the multihearth, the rotary kiln, the infrared, and the fluidized 		bed furnace.&nbsp; The multihearth furnace is the most commonly used 		furnace in already established treatment facilities.&nbsp; The fluidized 		bed furnace has more recently been incorporated in water treatment 		plants (Pontius, 1990)&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 		The main concern with the regeneration process is the carbon loss as a 		result of the regeneration.&nbsp; The source of the loss is usually 		caused by a poorly designed transportation system to furnace, and the 		temperature at which the furnace is operated.&nbsp; Through the course 		of the regeneration process, there are a few changes in the activated 		carbon that should be noted.&nbsp; These changes are a function of the 		type of furnace used and the conditions at which the furnace are 		operated.&nbsp; Inflicted alterations consist of changes to the pore 		size distribution, surface area, diameter, and hardness.&nbsp; Furnaces 		that operate at optimal conditions can minimize changes and return the 		activated carbon very closely to its original state.</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a furnace in the thermal regenerationprocess has its environmentalconcerns.&nbsp; The concerns stem from the organic compounds that areadsorbed.&nbsp; When spent carbon is put through the regenerationprocess thereis a possibility that the gaseous or liquid discharge will be in a highconcentration of organic material and these discharges would bereleased inenvironment.&nbsp; To prevent this environmental blunder, all furnacesareequipped with certain pollution control equipment.&nbsp; Scrubbers andafterburnersare used to minimize the concentration of such organics in thedischargestreams.&nbsp;
