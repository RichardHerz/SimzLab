		water, we think of lakes, rivers and oceans, rain and snow.&nbsp; 
		However it is also in the air (as humidity) which forms dew on cool 
		mornings or ice on your windshield in the winter.&nbsp; The humidity in 
		the air is also responsible for the water droplets that form on the 
		outside of your iced tea glass on a warm summer day.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">Water is the   critical
component of water sports, personal hygiene, agriculture and manufacturing
processes.&nbsp; An enormous quantity of fresh and salt water is used each day
throughout the world.&nbsp; For example, in 1990, the average daily water usage
in the United States was approximately 339,000 million gallons.&nbsp; That is
339,000,000,000 gallons or 339 BILLION gallons of water per day!&nbsp; By the
year 2000, this rate increased to 408 billion gallons per day.&nbsp; On a per
person basis in 1990, the U.S. average daily water usage in 1990 was 1,620
gallons, or 1,620 gpcd (gallons per capita per day).&nbsp; This value actually
decreased in 2000 to 1,430 gpcd even though close to 33 million more people
lived in the US according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (2005).</p>
<p align="justify">Think about it-if an average
bathtub holds 125 gallons, the daily U.S. water usage will fill over 2.7 billion
bathtubs, enough for 1 FULL bathtub for half the world’s population-EACH DAY.</p>

		<p align="justify">Where does all this water come from? A USGS report (2005)
states that approximately 85% of the total water used (345 bgd) is freshwater of
which 79% comes from surface water sources (rivers, lakes and reservoirs).&nbsp;
Where does all the water go?&nbsp; In 2000, Texas and California were
responsible for over 18% of the total freshwater consumption at 63.2 bgd.&nbsp;
Two additional states, Colorado and Nebraska had water consumption rates greater
than 12.5 bgd.&nbsp; These four states were responsible for over one-quarter of
the total daily freshwater consumption in the U.S.&nbsp; If you are like most
people (even if you live in California or Texas), it is highly unlikely that you
actually use 1,430 gallons of water each day for bathing, drinking, cooking
and/or brushing your teeth.&nbsp; In fact, most of the water is used in
industrial or commercial applications.&nbsp;</td>

		<p align="justify">In 2000, steam-generating power plants were responsible 
		for approximately 39% of the freshwater daily consumption.&nbsp; This 
		was primarily used for cooling water purposes.&nbsp; Due to their high 
		water demand, power plants have historically been located near large 
		bodies of water (the Great Lakes as well as large rivers and oceans).&nbsp; 
		Cropland irrigation represents 39% of the usage.&nbsp; Large-scale 
		irrigation is concentrated in the arid Western states.&nbsp; 
		Approximately 14% of the daily water consumption is used for public 
		water service.&nbsp; This includes water deliveries to domestic, 
		industrial, commercial and other public purposes (hospitals, pools, 
		parks and public buildings).&nbsp; Domestic service includes both indoor 
		and outdoor household applications such as drinking and cooking, 
		bathing, washing clothes, flushing toilets and watering lawns and 
		gardens.&nbsp; Over 60% of public water supplies come from surface water 
		sources.&nbsp; Some industries do not rely on public or municipal water 
		service to meet their water needs.&nbsp; Instead, they supply their own 
		water either from wells or surface water sources.&nbsp; This independent 
		industrial water consumption represented 5% of the total daily use.&nbsp; 
		Mining, aquaculture and livestock water consumption represents less than 
		3% of the total daily use.</td>

Industrial water requirements vary widely.&nbsp; For example, approximately
106,000 gallons are used in the production of a single automobile, 2,800 gallons
are needed to produce 1 kg (2.2 pounds) of aluminum, 1,300 gallons to produce 1
kg of rice, 230 gallons to produce 1 kg of paper and 60 gallons are needed for 1
kg of steel (Miller, 2004).</td>
