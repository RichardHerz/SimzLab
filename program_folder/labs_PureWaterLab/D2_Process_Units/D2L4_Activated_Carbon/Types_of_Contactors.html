The design and the configuration of the 		activated carbon contactor system should be chosen based on the 		characteristics of the influent stream and the treatment objective for 		the influent.&nbsp;

The two fundamental varieties of activated carboncontactorscan be categorized into fixed bed and moving bed contactors.&nbsp; Asthe nameimplies, the carbon bed in the fixed bed contactor remains at astandstill orfixed during operation.&nbsp; Fixed bed contactors can be operated in a<span class="SpellE">downflow</span> or <span class="SpellE">upflow</span>nature withrespect to the flow of the wastewater through the contactor.&nbsp; <span class="SpellE">Downflow</span> operation has the ability of performingdualfunctions: adsorption and filtration.&nbsp; The secondary function offiltration is necessary when the influent has high concentrations ofsuspendedsolids.&nbsp; Periodically, the contactor should be backwashed toremove thesuspended solids from the carbon bed.&nbsp; Given that, build up ofsuspendedsolids will hinder the adsorption capacity of the carbon and increasethe bedpressure drop or head loss.&nbsp; When a carbon bed is used inconjunction withfiltration media such as sand and gravel, the frequency of backwashingcan bereduced.&nbsp;

Pressure flow contactors can also handleinfluentstreams with a higher concentration of suspended solids with lessfrequentbackwashing.&nbsp; This is direct result of increased head to surmounttheincreasing head loss due to the higher concentration of suspendedsolids.&nbsp;The advantage to gravity flow is the lower energy cost associated withtheprocess.&nbsp;

The classcan be broken up into: expanded beds, and pulsed bed contactors.&nbsp;Inexpanded bed contactors, the flow rate of the influent is maintained atavelocity in which the flow rate is high enough to cause the carbon bedtoexpand upwards slightly.&nbsp; This type of configuration can be usedforinfluents that have both high and low concentrations of suspendedsolids.&nbsp;With an exceedingly high concentration, a <span class="SpellE">downflow</span>contactor would result in excessive head loss due to the accumulationofsuspended solids on the carbon bed when used as a secondary filtrationmedia.&nbsp; <span class="SpellE">Upflow</span> moving beds are limiting to 		those applications where downstream contamination by suspended solids or 		carbon residue would pose a problem.&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second type of moving bed contactor is calleda pulsedbed.&nbsp; In this type of contactor, the carbon bed is occasionallypulsed toremove exhausted carbon out the bottom of the contactor and the sameamount ofexhausted carbon that was discharge is replaced with fresh orreactivated carbonthrough the top of the contactor.&nbsp; The flow between the carbon andthewastewater is countercurrent.&nbsp; The advantage to this contactorconfiguration is optimal carbon utilization when properly executed, asonlycompletely exhausted carbon is withdrawn from the contactor.&nbsp; Asresult ofthe continuous replacement of exhausted carbon the system when operatedcorrectly will never be completely exhausted.&nbsp; This inhibitscontaminationof the effluent stream.&nbsp; Another result of the continuousreplacement ofthe exhausted carbon is that the set concentration of impurities in theeffluent is constant over an extended time period.&nbsp; <span class="GramE">Infixed bed contactors, the set concentration of the impurities allowedin theeffluent increases with respect to time in operation.</span>&nbsp;Below is adiagram of a typical pulsed bed contactor.&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td class="style1" style="width: 90%">		<img alt="Picture Pending" height="405" src="image003.jpg" width="335" /></td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 90%">&nbsp;</td>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td style="width: 5%">&nbsp;</td>		<td class="style1" style="width: 90%"><strong>Figure 8.&nbsp;

At larger scale water treatment facilities, multiplecontactors areoften used where rapid carbon exhaustion rate occur.&nbsp; When usingmultiplecontactors lower carbon usage rate can be achieved by arranging thecontactorsin either a series or parallel setup.&nbsp; As shown in Figure 8, theinfluentstream enters one contactor at a time and flows downward through thecarbonbed.&nbsp; In this type of setup, the lead unit will be the first <span class="GramE">contactor to have its carbon bed go</span> to exhaustion.&nbsp; When 		this happens, the lead unit is taken offline and the next unit in line 		becomes the lead unit.&nbsp; If the effluent requirements are very stringent 		and all units are needed to achieve this requirement, a standby 		contactor can be used while unit are taken offline for regeneration.&nbsp; 		When there is a build up of suspended solids, backwashing will only need 		to be done on the lead unit of the system.&nbsp; Lower carbon usage rates can 		be achieved in a series setup, because units are taken offline for 		regeneration only after the entire carbon bed is exhausted.&nbsp;
